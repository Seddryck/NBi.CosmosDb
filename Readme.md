# NBi.CosmosDb #
NBi.CosmosDb is an extension to the [NBi testing framework](http://www.nbi.io) (add-on to NUnit) for **Business Intelligence** and **Data centric** applications. This extension lets you run tests defined within NBi on an Azure CosmosDb database. At the moment only the graph/gremlin API is supported.
